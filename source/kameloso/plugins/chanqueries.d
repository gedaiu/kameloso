 +  The Channel Queries service queries channels for information about them (in
 +  terms of topic and modes) as well as its list of participants. It does this
 +  shortly after having joined a channel, as a service to all other plugins,

 +
 +  It has no commands.
 +
 +  It is qualified as a service, so while it is not technically mandatory, it
 +  is highly recommended if you plan on mixing in
 +  `kameloso.plugins.common.ChannelAwareness` in your plugins.
